# weather-forecast
Weather outlook for multiple cities.
## Description
As a developer, I was given the task of creating a weather dashboard from scratch. I needed to use third-party APIs to retrieve current and future weather data for cities. The 5 Day Weather Forecast API was used, requiring coordinates instead of just city names. I also had to include search history functionality and present a 5-day forecast with city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. To store data persistently, I used localStorage. For more information on API key usage, I referred to the Full-Stack Blog.
